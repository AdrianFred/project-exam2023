![image](/public/Holidaze.png)

## Description

This is our exam project to make a fully function website in React/Nextjs for a "company" called Holidaze. The website is a venue booker for hotels, guesthouses and B&B's. The website is made with React/Nextjs, Tailwindcss and their provided API.

I started out making this website in a figma design file with a style guide. I then changed stuff throught the project to make it more user friendly and better looking. The provided API was used to get the data for the venues and the bookings. Creating users and authenticating users was also done through the API.
There was also an "admin" page of this website, where you could manage the venues you managed. You could also see the bookings for the venues you managed.
